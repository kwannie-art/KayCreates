# KayCreates
This will be used as a website to display all of my creative ideas and talents
I will show off my art 
DIY projects that I have completed
Clothing that i have made and designed
I will show how and where I get my inspiration
While navigating the website I hope I am able to give the viewer a more eccetric futuristic laid back vibe.
I want to be able to and a shop where people can shop online for my products and service.
I will only be using the basics to create this project because I am only a beginner
but I would like to see how long the project will take me to complete.
